<h1>Education</h1>
<p>I began my education in the little town of Vinica, where I currently live in. There I started my education in the ,,Slavcho Stojmenski" elementary school.
At that school I learned the basics and I made many friends, some of which I continue to hangout with till this very day.
I attended that school till the ninth grade, at which then I continued my education at the ,,Vancho Prke" high school also in Vinica. There I first learned
some of the basics of programming in C++. Needless to say it sparked a love of programming in me. After finishing high school I continued my education in the
    Faculty of Computer Science and Engineering in Skople also known as FINKI. As of June 2025 I am at my second semester at the college and I plan to finish it :)</p>
